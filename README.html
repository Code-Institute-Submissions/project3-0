    <h1><font color="#990000">Ciaran Quinlan - Project 2 - API project
      </font></h1>
    <p>For the second project I have chosen to do a sample application
      using the Magento ecommerce API. I have chosen this API because I
      am somewhat familiar with the application but I have never used
      its api.<br>
      I may work with this in the future and I want to investigate
      further how to use this API.<br>

    <h2>Magento Ecommerce system</h2>
    <p><b>Magento</b> is an <a

    <p>The current opensourtce version is Magento 2.3.1 and this is the
      version i will be working with. Sometimes I will refer to it
      simply as M2<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Magento API description and summary
    </h2>
    <p>The Magento web API framework provides integrators and developers
      the means to use web services to communicate with the Magento
      ecommerce system. </p>
    <p>The Magento API support both REST (Representational State
      Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). for my project
      I will use the REST API but the Magento 2 web API coverage is the
      same for both REST and SOAP.
      The documentation for the Mahento API is locatd here
      https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/get-started/bk-get-started-api.html




The
      learning outcomes for this section of the course include: being
      able to access external resources, work with external data,
      deserialize JSON data, and create data tables with pagination.</p>
    <p><br>
      As i researched the API i aslo realised that authentication is
      required and also the use of other libraries like require JS </p>
    <h2>Getting the environment setup.</h2>
    <p>In order to start the project I had to install the Magento
      application on a server (it is too complicated to install this
      locally).</p>
    <ol>
      <li> The details of installing are in the link <a
          href="docs/Magento-Install.html">Magento Install details.</a><br>
        I installed Magento in the root directory of my domain under a
        https url.<br>
        I installed&nbsp; Magento at :<a
          href="https://ciaranquinlan.com"> https://ciaranquinlan.com</a></li>
      <li>The application comes with a default theme and i installed
        this so i can get started quickly.</li>
      <li>I need shell access to the Magento file system to do admin
        tasks. I had to enable this on my hosting account and<br>
        how i <a href="docs/ssh.html">setup ssh </a>is detailed here.</li>
      <li>I created a local directory so I could git updates as the
        project progressed, only files i worked on were in my git repo.<br>
        TYhese are all in a directory on the server called project2.<br>
      </li>
      <li>To use and configure M2 you need to use the Magento command
        line interface on the server. <br>
        This <a href="docs/Magento-Commands.html">document details how
          I set myself up to use the Magento CLI.</a></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sample data.</h3>
    <p>I installed a sample set of data based on a yoga store with the
      Luma theme.<br>
      I created a number of customers and a number of orders so i could
      test the system<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Project outline</h2>
    <p>The project will create a Html/Javascript/JQuery file that will
      connect to the Magento 2 API on my domain.<br>
      The page will return product, customer or order data based on the
      requests made from the user.</p>
    <h3>Project phases.</h3>
    The first objective is to get the connection working to the M2 API.<br>
    A basic html file will be created based on <a
      href="wireframes/MagentoAPIPage.png">this mockup </a>to test the
    connection.<br>
    The html file will have three sections where the user will be able
    to enter the search string and see the returned data<br>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>order id&nbsp; - to return order
          information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li>product type - to return matching product information</li>
        <li>customer name&nbsp; to return matching customer informatio</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    Simple styling of the data will be done initially and then the code
    will be integrated into a bootstrap template.<br>
    The page should react when the customer enters the order id ,
    product or customer info and&nbsp; displays some relevant data<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Selecting a Theme.</h3>
    I choose the Regna bootstrap theme and i will use this to display
    the data.<br>
