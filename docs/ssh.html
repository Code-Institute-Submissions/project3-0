    <h2>Create keys for ssh into Magento server
    </h2>
    <br>
    In order to execute commands in Magento I have to log in to my
    Magento Server via SSH.<br>
    To do this I needed to setup key-based SSH authentication instead of
    plain username &amp; password. <br>
    <br>
    I generated an SSH key pair (public and a private key) and copied
    the private key into a text file on my computer.
    <br>
    <br>
    I loaded the private key into the SSH-agent using your Mac Terminal
    using the ssh-add command:
    <br>
    <pre>ssh-add ./private_key
</pre>
    I&nbsp; had to chmod the file to 400 to get it to add. <br>
    Then i was able to login to the magento server and go directly to
    the magento home directiry with the following command in terminal
    <br>
    <br>
    <pre>ssh -t kerryfis@77.104.160.142   -p 18765 'cd /home/kerryfis/public_html/ciaranquinlan.com;bash'



</pre>
